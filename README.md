The Steem Messenger !
______________________________

Chat securely with the power of the Steem blockchain !

### About the project

Steem Messenger aims to be the ultimate chat application for the Steem blockchain.

Designed for privacy, with the clever use of the Private Memo Key to authenticate yourself into the Messenger's network, you'll soon be able to safely engage with everybody on the Steem social network without needing anything more than your recipient username.

### Technology stack

For the frontend, we use Javascript in a *NodeJS style* thanks to `Browserify`. The backend is written in NodeJS, and uses MongoDB as a database.

We use the Steem blockchain as a Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure (DPKI).

User authentication is done by a fix hmac derivation from the private memo key. The user also authenticates the server with the same method.

The encryption is made with AES-GCM, for its security, and also performance.

We use a local encrypted wallet to store user keys, like the memo private key. This wallet is secured with a password derived with Scrypt. 

### Installation guide

To test this release, you need Node.js, and MongoDB.

Simply use `npm i` into the directory, start `mongod`, and then type `npm run start`. You can now go to `localhost:4000` !
